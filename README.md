# Corey Foard â€“ Technical Writer

As a technical writer and content designer, I create digital content that makes complex concepts accessible, empowering users to adopt and engage with digital tools confidently. With expertise in usability, enablement, and information design, I have designed content that helps users realize greater value through support guides, in-app guidance, and video training modules. Whether designing scalable content systems, optimizing processes for efficiency, or diving deep into user feedback, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and its users, enabling success every step of the way.


This repository contains a collection of some of the technical and UX writing project I have completed over the last five years. If you have any questions or would like more details, please contact me at coreyfoard22@gmail.com.
