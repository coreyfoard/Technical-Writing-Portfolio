# Receipt Service #

Receipt Service is the persistence layer for receipt data. Itâ€™s responsible for saving and retrieving receipt data. The method of storage is considered an implementation detail and out of scope when defining the API.

## Running Locally

## Documentation

Documentation for this service's provided API is published directly alongside the service using echo-swagger at:
`/swagger/index.html`.  The documentation is created using some instrumented comments,
so make sure to add them when creating new handler functions.

### Generating Documentation

To generate documentation using [swaggo/swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) install swag:
```text
go get github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@v1.6.6
```

And issue the following command to generate the docs for the whole project:
```text
swag init
```

On Linux you may need to add `$HOME/go/bin` to your `$PATH` to find the swag binary.

### Configure jFrog Artifcatory

If you haven't already, make sure you setup your `GOPROXY` and other Go environment variables.  Documentation can 
be found [here](https://fetchrewards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/edit-v2/1252818979)

### Environment Selection ###

The configuration loaded is dependent on an environment variable called `ENVIRONMENT`. The value is directly correlated
to which yml config file is loaded from `./config/*.yml`. For example, setting the environment variable like 
`ENVIRONMENT=dev` will load the `dev.yml` config file.

* From command line `go run main.go`

## Testing ##

### From the command line

`go test ./...`

If you want verbose output:

`go test ./... -v`

### In GoLand

You can right click to run individual tests/test files from the context menu.

### Integration Tests

Integration Tests can be found in the `/test` directory. And are marked with the `integration` build flag.

```
// +build integration
```

These tests are ran against live environments so are not CI/CD-safe and should only be ran manually.

To run these tests `cd` into the test directory and run `go test --tags=integration`

### Integration Tests

Integration Tests can be found in the `/test` directory. And are marked with the `integration` build flag.

```
// +build integration
```

Currently integration tests only run locally, but you can execute them using something like the following command:
```text
ENVIRONMENT=preprod go test -tags integration ./...
```
